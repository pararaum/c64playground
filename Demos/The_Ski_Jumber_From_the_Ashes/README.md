# Ski Jumper from the Ashes

This demo on one disk side tells about what happened after the "Ski Jumper Full of Energy" found their disgraceful end in our previous demo ([Ski Jumper Full of Energy](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=250820)).

The demo runs on a stock C64.

To play, run the first file on the disk.  
The demo includes a fastloader. Therefore, disable other fastloaders and ensure that only one disk drive (1541 or SD2IEC) is connected.

Enjoy!
