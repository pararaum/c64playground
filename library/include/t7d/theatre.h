/* \file theatre.h
 *
 * A framework for producing theatre plays, visual novels and the
 * like. Each play will have acts which will define backgrounds,
 * sprites, data, etc. Each act consists of several scenes, and each
 * scene consists of several pictures.
 *
 * Initialisation of the theatre is done using the theatre_init()
 * function. After initialisation the interrupt is set to rasterline
 * 250 and the screen is blanked.
 *
 * After calling scene_init() the display is activated, the
 * configuration (isr and inter-picture functions) is set and finally
 * the picture functions called.
 *
 * In each picture actions on the screen can be taken, sprites can be
 * moved and text screens displayed. Using the
 * teatre_switch_to_windowed() function a text window can be opened in
 * which text can be displayed.
 *
 * The THEATRE_???? constants define how the usual memory layout is
 * expected to be.
